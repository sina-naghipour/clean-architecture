# ADR-001: Clean Architecture Project Structure

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a maintainable, testable structure for the Tennis Kata that demonstrates Clean Architecture principles. The code should be organized to separate business logic from infrastructure concerns and be easily testable.

## Decision
We adopt a Clean Architecture structure with the following principles:

### Project Structure
```text
kata-refactors/
├── src/ # Production code
│ └── tennis/ # Tennis domain module
│ ├── init.py
│ └── game.py # Core business logic
├── tests/ # Test code
│ ├── init.py
│ └── tennis_test.py # Test cases
├── requirements.txt # Dependencies
└── configuration files # Tool configurations
```


### Core Principles
1. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward (domain → infrastructure)
2. **Testability**: Business logic independent of frameworks
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one reason to change
4. **Explicit Dependencies**: No hidden dependencies

### Tooling Stack
- **ruff**: Linting and formatting
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **coverage**: Test coverage measurement
- **pre-commit**: Git hook management

## Consequences

### Positive
- Business logic is framework-agnostic
- Easy to test in isolation
- Clear boundaries between components
- Professional development workflow

### Negative
- More boilerplate for simple projects
- Steeper learning curve for beginners
- Additional configuration overhead

## Compliance
- All new code must follow this structure
- Tests must maintain ≥80% coverage
- Pre-commit hooks must pass before commits
- Type hints required for all public interfaces
